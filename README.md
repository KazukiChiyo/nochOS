# nochOS
*Ein Anderer OS.*

This is an educational 32-bit Unix operating system built from scratch. To run nochOS with QEMU, first install QEMU for i386 (and not for x64 system): `sudo apt install qemu-system-i386`. Then use `qemu-system-i386 nochOS.img` to run OS image with QEMU. Ignore any warning messages.
